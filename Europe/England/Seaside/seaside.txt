You decide to head to the seaside.
As you walk along the beach, watching the waves, a sea foam wave continues on to reveal it's true form of a beautiful horse with a saddle.
It knickers happily and trots over to you.
Suddenly, you feel the compulsion to get onto the horse and follow it, not seeing the darnger.
As you get on, the horse starts running towards the water, and you notice that the horse is no longer soft and sleek.
It's hair is slimy, and the saddle is made from kelp.
With horror, you realize the horse is a kelpie and is going to kill then eat you.

You are drowned by the kelpie, which then feasts on your flesh.

GAME OVER
