You decide to wait until Nightfall. The guards are unprepared and easy to take out. As you start to release the creatures, you find a phoenix in the covered crate that you saw earlier.
You use you magic to create a suitcase larger on the inside to hold all the rescued animals.
You head back to America to rehabilitate the animals and leave China behind.
